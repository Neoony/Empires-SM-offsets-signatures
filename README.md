# Empires-SM-offsets-signatures
Updated offsets and signatures for empires </br>

Correct file placements </br>
empires/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/sdkhooks.games/custom/game.empires.txt </br>
empires/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/sdktools.games/custom/game.empires.txt </br>

SM will use files from custom folder to override. </br>

Hooks needs testing. </br>

Offsets and signatures pulled from: </br>
https://forums.empiresmod.com/index.php?threads/calculating-updated-sourcemod-vtable-offsets.20571/ </br>

Currently from vtablescanner3.zip </br>
https://delftelectronics.nl/empires/tools/vtablescanner3.zip </br>

These seem originally intended only for sdktools (I guess), but I tryed adding them to hooks as well. </br>
So that would need testing. </br>
